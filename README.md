MMaziwa is a small-scale Dairy Farm Information Management System refers to a system that automates the activities of small-scale dairy farmers.This is because farmers practicing this type of farming keep their records manually or even don't keep their records at all. 
By having a platform by which they can input their cows' data they can keep it safe and secure hence having references in the future. 
Also, they can input through the app the amount of milk they have sold and how much they earned by doing so.

# Problem Statement
The challenge in collecting proper and accurate milk production information hinders the exploitation of Kenya's full potential for the economic contribution of the dairy sector. 
Many choose to memorize the cows' inputs and outputs. This is dangerous because the cows' details are so many and ever-changing on a day-to-day basis. 
Novice farmers cannot memorize such especially if they have a quite large number of cows that are being milked at a given period e.g., 4 (a large number for a small-scale farmer). 
Also, because they don't record the amount of input they are feeding the cattle, they are prone to overfeeding the animals or even underfeeding them.

# In-scope
Enable the farmer to input their details such as name, email address, and password. This will be necessary for the event a farmer losses his/her device.
Enable the recording of a cow's milk production for the entire day.
Store the cows' data which can be used for future reference by the farmer.

# Out-of-scope
Record other outputs of the cow such as meat production since the app strictly deals with dairy cattle.
Record inputs of any other animal except a dairy cow such as a goat.
Record inputs of a cow i.e., its' not focused on what a cow is consuming but rather what it is producing.

# Justification 
All types of farmers will be able to use it hence ensuring the average learned farmer from the rural area can use it.
It is much easier to input a record digitally than to get a book and start filling it.
The farmers can access their records even if the records phone gets lost since they can simply login into their account and get their records back unlike when a book is lost, the records are gone forever.

# Application Development Methodology 
The waterfall model is used for the development of the recording system for milk producers. This methodology is considered the classic style of software development which clarifies the application development process in a linear sequential flow. 
This means that any phase in the development process starts when the earlier phase is completed.

# Conclusions
The project was a success whereby the said system (mobile application) was designed and can now be used in real life by a degree student.
It contains real-life applications such as the M-Pesa platform whereby many are now used to it and therefore nothing new.
It is also so simple to login details hence will be much easy for the farmers to key in their day-to-day activities.

# Recommendations
The county governments should incorporate such an application to see how it can be used by small-scale dairy farmers.
They should also improve it for it to move to the next level i.e., Large-scale dairy users, and in this case, administrators will be involved in monitoring milk production.
